## Usage

Using the **PRNG-D-64** is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

### Example Code

```c
#include "prng_d_64.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize the PRNG
    prng_d_64_t rng;
    prng_d_64_init(&rng, seed_value);

    // Generate random numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        uint64_t random_number = prng_d_64_generate(&rng);
        printf("Random Number %d: %llu\n", i + 1, random_number);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Parameters

- **seed_value**: Initialize the generator with a seed for reproducibility.
- **prng_d_64_generate**: Call this function to get a new random number.
